# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data 
In this project, i made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. </br>
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.</br>
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.</br>
## The Datasets:
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:</br>
</br>
**Start Time** (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)</br>
**End Time** (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)</br>
**Trip Duration** (in seconds - e.g., 776)</br>
**Start Station** (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)</br>
**End Station** (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)</br>
**User Type** (Subscriber or Customer)</br>
</br>
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:</br>
Gender</br>
Birth Year</br>
</br>
## Statistics Computed:
I started by learning about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.then wrote code to provide the following information:</br>
</br>
### 1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
</br>
most common month</br>
most common day of week</br>
most common hour of day</br>
</br>

### 2) Popular stations and trip
</br>
most common start station</br>
most common end station</br>
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)</br>
</br>

### 3) Trip duration
</br>
total travel time</br>
average travel time</br>
</br>

### 4) User info
</br>
counts of each user type</br>
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)</br>
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)</br>
</br>
